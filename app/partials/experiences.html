                            <h2>WHAT I KNOW</h2>
                        <p> I've spent much of the last 5 years of my life soley devoted to studying and learning how to code (And code correctly at that!).<br> <br>I've dabbled in C++, and played with robots in Python. I've made apps for my phone in Java and built websites for friends, fun and fortune using HTML5, Javascript and CSS.<br><br> But my main focus has been developing desktop and web applications using C# and the .Net frameworks. As of late this has transistioned into .Net Backend development, mixed with the latest Js, Jquery and Css frameworks and libraries on the front end.
