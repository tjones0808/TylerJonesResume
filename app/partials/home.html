                        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                        <p>My name is Tyler Jones and I was born in Torrence, CA. When I was about 5 years old I moved to central Michigan. It was their I started college at Michigan State University where I focused on a General Business
                            and Finance degree. <br><br>After two years at MSU I moved to South Carolina not really knowing what it was I wanted to do with my life.<br><br> I had always been somewhat of a technologist and during the summer of 2010 I took my first programming class. It was also around the same time that the movie Social Network came out in theatres. I remember watching the movie about a 21 year old college dropout                                 that made billions of dollars with an idea, his laptop and a little code and thinking....I have to do this. I spent that summer learning as much as possible about coding and by the end of that summer I even landed my first "contract". $500 dollars to change about 10 lines of HTML. <br><br> After that first job I never looked back. I love what I do, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.</p>
